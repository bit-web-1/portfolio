<h1><strong>Interactive Application</strong></h1>

    <h2><strong>Research</strong></h2>
    <p>My ideas were all over the place when I started planning this project. I had ones where I have no idea how to start or do because I am still fresh with animation and with Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>I had ended up trying to search up tutorials on how to create an interactive animation which was a struggle because there wasn't a lot. But a tutorial from In Learning helped me alot with creating this very simple animation which includes basic interactiveness.</p>

            <h2><strong>Plan</strong></h2>
            <p>Below is a screenshot of the ideas I had brainstormed. I originally wanted to create another version of the Snake game like the train game above.
                I had done it on C# in my programming class so I thought converting it an animation plus Javascript would be fun and easy. But it got really complicated
                especially since I don't have a lot of animation skills and on top of that, Javascript. I had talked to some people in my class and some of them were using an
                online game maker. I tried to search for one that will help me create a snake type of game but it was unsuccessful since I don't have any experience creating those kinds of games
                with an online maker. So I went back to trying Adobe Animate. It's the software that we're learning and Javascript anyway so I didn't use an online game maker.
