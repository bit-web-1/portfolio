<h1><strong>Video Project</strong></h1>
<div class="wrapper">
    <h2><strong>Research</strong></h2>
    <p>My initial idea was to create a workout video wherein my actor will perform sets of workouts within a timeframe. I've targeted my audiences to be people who are wanting to start gyming hence the no equipment workout idea. But then later on, my actor gave me the idea of showing them proper technique or form when doing a squat and a push up. This idea makes more sense as it kind of falls under a life hack video in a way.</p>

            <h2><strong>Plan</strong></h2>
            <p>I made a script as well as a shot list during the planning of this video to brainstorm possibilities that I would want to show in my video. I had planned for the filming to occur all in one day. The equipment I used was just my phone and my laptop (to look at my plans). One mistake I did was that I forgot to borrow a tripod from Polytechnic before the shooting. I couldn't borrow on the day of filming as it was on a Saturday morning. I tried asking for friends that may have the possibility of owning one but they didn't have a phone holder for it. Other than that, the filming itself was done smoothly.</p>

    <h2><strong>Editing</strong></h2>
    <p>Adobe Premiere Pro was my chosen editing software for this project. It was actually the first time I've used this software so it was confusing to me at first. But I lik learning how to use a new software so it all worked out at the end. The tabs at the top helped me figure out what I should be doing first. Renaming my videos and audios were very helpful to me because it gave me an idea of what the video/audio content was about. I didn't have to play every single one again to find out which video I was looking for.</p>

            <h2><strong>Design Decisions</strong></h2>
            <p>One of the first things I wanted to make sure in my video is the atmosphere. It had to be bright and very natural so that the audience would feel motivated or even welcomed to try the ideas mentioned in the video. When it comes to the framing, I actually had the idea of taking still close up shots of the body parts that he mentioned and putting that photograph within the clip wherein he describes it. But my editing skills stopped me from doing that. An alternative I thought was to transition the photos into cuts but the problem I had with that is it could be too much or the audience if it cuts way too much scene to photo, scene to photo because the photos would just be quick. So I decided to scratch that idea even though it would be better to show more camera shots within the video.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, Youtube has so much training / workout videos from different kinds of people with different kinds of video styles. It could be a vlog style video wherein the person holds the camera and just leave the camera on the ground filming the themselves while working out or it could be just a camera set on a tripod and the whole workout is filmed in one shot, no angles whatsoever. Or it could also be a two person video where there's a cameraman and the other person talking and explaining. In saying that, I think my video is consistent with a normal Youtube video as it didn't really require high tech cameras and tripods and whole team of videographers. I didn't require a whole team of editors who would make my video a cinematic film quality.</p>

    <h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2>
    <p>The only material I used that wasn't my own is the music. I searched through Google Stock Music for music that could potentially make the video and I found one. I used this throughout the whole video.</p>

            <h2><strong>Documentation</strong></h2>
            <h4><b><i>Which tools/applications you used and why</i></b></h4>
            <p>As I said earlier, I had a go at using the Adobe Premier Pro for editing my video. I've wanted to use this application because I wanted to learn the industry standard for video making. I've played around the tools that I think will be helpful but the parts that are very helpful to me was definitely the timeline, program monitor and in out points to trim the videos and audio. I used the sound mixer to increase and decrease the volumes of my music and audio because I wanted to have them playing at the same time. I added some effects on my intro video because I had the vision of a blurry scene so all attention will go to the title of the video. I also added some text and cuts for transition effects.</p>

            <figcaption><i>Only music is playing. No audio, so the volume is quite high.</i></figcaption>

            <img src="videoStuff/talkingAudio.png" alt="Both Music & Audio">
            <figcaption><i>Music and audio are both playing. The audio is actually a bit low so I tried to decrease the music volume lower than the audio so that you can clearly hear what he's saying but still hear the music playing in the background.</i></figcaption>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>Why you believe your use of tools/applications was competent</i></b></h4>
            <p>I believe the use of these tools / applications was competent because I had a little bit of knowledge of filming and editing beforehand. I've done a bit of photography during high school so I had knowledge on how to handle a camera. I did some video projects during that time also. Even though I didn't use the industry standard back then, I still had a bit of knowledge and understanding of what I'm supposed to be doing.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>How you exported your work and why you did it that way</i></b></h4>
            <p>I exported my project using the Media Encoder. I had to search up how to export because I don't actually know how to do this as I've never posted a Youtube video before. It took me a few tries but I finally got Youtube to accept it on an mp4 format.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>How you managed assets during project work</i></b></h4>
            <p>On my laptop, I made a Multimedia folder which holds folders for each of my projects that I done so far. One of them is a Video Project folder. Within this folder, I put all my screenshots, scripts and any other documentation for my portfolio. All my video clips, voice memos and actual video cut footage is stored on a hard drive just in case my laptop storage runs out.</p>
