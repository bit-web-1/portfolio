            <h3><strong><i>UI Element Sketches</i></strong></h3>
            <p>These sketches mostly consist of squares and triangles. I used these shapes because it's the shape of a pizza box as well as a sliced pizza. I wanted to make that connection of the idea and the design.</p>

            <br>
            <h3><strong><i>Wireframes</i></strong></h3>
            <p>I have exported these wireframes as jpeg images but when I put it here, it doesn't clearly show the division between the art boards (It looks like one page). So I decided to screenshot each art board.</p>

            <p>For my homepage, I wanted it to be clear and straight forward because I would assume that some people could be in a hurry when their ordering they're food.</p>
            <p>The Menu page of my application will show all the food choices. Within this page, there's a mini navigation panel for the category of the food (pizza, dessert, sides, etc).</p>
            <p>The idea of having graphics / icons instead of text for the mini navigation is from Hell Pizza. I didn't want to include photos of the actual dish on the app because it would just take up too much space. Having icons would make it more interesting.</p>
            <p>My checkout page is pretty much the same layout as the menu. The only difference would be the content as well as you could edit your orders still until you proceed to the payment.</p>

    <h2><strong>Mockups</strong></h2>
    <p>I had made 2 or 3 versions of each screen because I want to see which works and which doesn't.</p>
    <h3><strong><i>Screen 1: Homepage</i></strong></h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <img src="uiStuff/HomeOrder1.jpg" alt="Homepage 1st Version">
            <figcaption><i>Version 1</i></figcaption>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img src="uiStuff/HomeOrder2.png" alt="Homepage 2nd Version">
            <figcaption><i>Version 2</i></figcaption>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img src="uiStuff/HomeOrder3.png" alt="Homepage 3rd Version">
            <figcaption><i>Version 3</i></figcaption>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>For this screen, I got the idea of choosing what the customer might want to do from dominoes and from another app that I failed to take note of. I didn't want to populate this screen with too much details like the Dominoes one because I think it's way too cluttered.</p>
    <p>For version 1, I had this brown background with some kind of pattered texture to it because I wanted it to kind of represent the crust of the pizza. But I thought it was too dark and that it doesn't look right with the red tone from the title and the graphics. And so it lead me to version 2.</p>
    <p>In version 2, I made the title of the app bigger than the rest of the text because I was thinking of Hierarchy. I was a bit conflicted because I was not sure if the title is more important than the customer's choices. I was also conflicted because there's too much space around each element so I tried to put arrows so at least it would look like a button. But it didn't make sense. As for the background, I changed the color to an almost grey color and kept the texture for the bottom part. I got this idea from the Pizza Hut app where the background kind of alternates from a smooth one to a textured background. I thought it looked nice so I tried incorporating it for this screen.</p>
    <p>In version 3, I added bits of elements such as the logo, some text, lines and more buttons so that I could make use of the space. I realised I was not incorporating elements such as asking if the customer wants to sign up or login. So I started looking back and forth from the Pizza Hut app and mine to really identify elements that I need and don't need. I reduced the size of the logo because I decided it wasn't that much more important than the order options below. I added lines around View Menu, Pick Up and Delivery because it somehow indicates that it could be clickable. I feel like it encourages the user to click it. Then moving on to the last bit of the screen, I made the background brown again but this time, a bit lighter and away from the red color. I wanted this section to be a bit noticeable too but not take away too much attention from the above elements.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><strong><i>Screen 2: Menu</i></strong></h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <img src="uiStuff/MENU1.png" alt="Menu 1st Version">
            <figcaption><i>Version 1</i></figcaption>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img src="uiStuff/MENU2.png" alt="Menu 2nd Version">
            <figcaption><i>Version 2</i></figcaption>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>As I said, I didn't want to put pictures of each pizza in this menu because it will take up a lot of space, and also, I don't think lots of people even looks at the photos in these kinds of apps anymore because pizza is pizza and the only difference is the toppings. All the customer will ever want to know is what will be in it. Also, this no-pizza-photo inspiration came from Hell Pizza.</p>
    <p>In saying that, I created graphics to represent the options that we have. This was also inspired by Hell Pizza. I really liked the idea of the color popping from just the graphics as well as the titles.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure which of these versions I like better. If I would make another version, it would be version 2 but the options layed out like the ones in version 1. And possibly text that would accompany the graphics.</p>
    <p>In terms of hierarchy, I know the size of the title aren't that much bigger than the name of the pizzas itself but red definitely makes it more different. I decided to put the popular pizzas at the top because I would want the customer's know what pizzas we make the best.</p>

    <h3><strong><i>Screen 3: Checkout</i></strong></h3>
    <div class="row">

    <p>This might be the least favorite screen I had to do out of the 3 screens. These screens that I made are definitely missing some elements because I know checkouts needs to display a lot of information. I was having trouble identifying elements that I need and don't need. It was also hard because I could not see the checkout screen of the pizza apps because I'm not actually ordering pizza from them. So I had to google search some examples. The only checkout screen that appealed to me is this photo on the right, which has nothing to do with pizzas.</p>

            <h2><strong>Documentation</strong></h2>
            <p>My UI Design is based on pizza ordering mobile application. This idea was inspired by the pizza program that I created in Programming 2. The UI we made in Programming 2 didn't really look great so I decided I wanted to try and make it more presentable. I have made up a name for my client ("Peppizza Parlour"). Even though the business is not real, I would assume design decisions that would fit and make sense to the idea of a pizza parlour app.</p>
            <p>Since this is an online ordering mobile application, my intended audience would be the people who, for some reason, won't be able to go instore and order over the counter. I want the UI for this application to be easy to navigate, and straight forward to the user without making it too boring.​​​​​​​</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>Which tools/applications you used and why</i></b></h4>
            <p>I used Adobe Illustrator to sketch out my UI elements as well as my wireframes because I'm only using lines and shapes and nothing more.</p>
            <p>But for my mockups, I used Adobe Photoshop because I'm manipulating some images and putting everything together from buttons, to colors and typography.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>How you used the features of these tools/applications</i></b></h4>
            <p>In Illustrator, I used multiple artboards in one project when I made up my wireframes. I made use of most of the shape tools to create spaces for my elements. I used the type tool to just take note of what element I want in a particular area. Those are most of the features that I used to just create a wireframe and sketches for my elements.</p>
            <p>As for Photoshop, I used a lot more features. For the logo, I used the elliptical type tool to have an idea of how big I want my logo to be. Without deselecting the area I selected, I used the brush tool to give a half circle effect. I played around with the brush properties to create that texture I have as well as the color. I also used the type tool to write the name of my app.</p>
            <p>For the rest of my mockups in photoshop, most of the features I used was the rectangular shape tool, type tool, color picker and most of all, the layers. For the graphics, I downloaded them from google (labeled for reuse with modification) and manipulated some parts of it so that everything looks kind of matching. I either filled in a black color within the image or added a black stroke. I added a little bit of texture to some of my backgrounds so that it doesn't look too plain.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>Why you believe your use of tools/applications was competent</i></b></h4>
            <p>The reason that I believe that my use of these applications are competent is because of my past experiences especially with photoshop. I had used Photoshop for 2 years during high school and I have learned lots of skills around that time. However, I have not used Illustrator before but I think with the knowledge of Photoshop that I have, it was still easy to get around Illustrator as it looks almost the same with almost the same tools. Also, I didn't really do anything too complicated in Illustrator.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>How you exported your work and why you did it that way</i></b></h4>
            <p>For files that doesn't involve any graphics or color, such as the wireframes and elements, I exported them as JPEG photos.</p>
            <p>For my mockups, I exported them by clicking Save for Web Legacy and changed the preset to PNG 24. Because I found out that PNG is a losseless format and it supports a wider range of colours whereas if you use JPEG, it's kind of lossy and it doesn't support transparency.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b><i>How you managed assets during project work</i></b></h4>
            <p>I like being organised and identifying files right away when I need it. I use my personal laptop when I made this project so it was easy for me to keep and navigate my files. Didn't have to put it on a usb to work on it in different computers. I saved my files in my Creative Cloud Files folder and just created folders that are appropriate such as Mockups for my mockup psd files, Exports for my exported files whether it be a png or jpg. Example is shown below.</p>
